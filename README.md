# Christmas_Tree
This project is an easy and nice way to celebrate Christmas as a developer! Is a simple buy beautiful tree, all in Python!

For this project, I used the _Turtle_ library, it allows you to draw your ideas in a Python script and display results in a friendly window (you can personalize it, as well).
